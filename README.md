# [MinRNNs for Lagrangian-Based Simulations of Transient Flow Problems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-97554-7_17)

This is the official repository for the paper [*MinRNNs for Lagrangian-Based Simulations of Transient Flow Problems*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-97554-7_17).  
This repository contains the code for the surrogate model of 2D Lagrangian fluid and multimaterial simulations.

The repository also includes the [appendix of the paper](https://github.com/dodydharma/minRNNsFlow/blob/main/docs/appendix.pdf) in the `docs` directory.
